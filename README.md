Baibulo (*version* in Chewa) is a versioned static content server and manager package for Node express applications. It is a version of implementation of approach [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVYP3cPcWQ) on RailsConf 2014 by Luke Melia.

Baibulo uses file system to store versioned static content. By default it uses a 2-level-up path - this needs to be made configurable.
